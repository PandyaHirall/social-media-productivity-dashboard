Impact of Social Media on Productivity & Well-Being

📁 Dataset Source
We used the open-source dataset [Social Media vs Productivity](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdimashayekhi/social-media-vs-productivity) from Kaggle.

Project Goal
To explore how daily digital habits — especially social media usage — affect:
- Productivity (actual vs perceived)
- Stress & burnout
- Sleep and job satisfaction

Key Research Questions
1. How does daily social media time affect actual and perceived productivity?
2. Do digital wellbeing tools (focus apps, limited screen time) reduce stress?
3. Are certain platforms associated with higher stress or lower satisfaction?
4. Is screen time before sleep linked to reduced sleep and lower job satisfaction?

Key Metrics & KPIs Tracked:
Average Daily Social Media Time: 3.08 hours  
Actual Productivity Score: 4.97  
Job Satisfaction Score: 4.95  
Stress Level Distribution 
Platform-wise Productivity Trends  
Burnout Rate by Age Group
Sleep Hours vs Stress

1 **KPI Cards**
1.1. Social Media Time: 3.08 hrs| Average time spent daily across platforms
1.2.  Productivity Score: 4.97 (Actual), 4.9–5.1 across platforms 
1.3. Job Satisfaction: 4.95 average| Average satisfaction with one’s current work life
- These cards present a **high-level snapshot** of key performance indicators.
- We observe that even with **moderate media use**, the actual productivity score hovers around **4.9–5.0**, suggesting resilience in output but possibly under self-reported perception biases.

2. **Social Media Time vs Actual Productivity** (column Chart)
- TikTok users spend the most time on social media (~5.1 hrs/day), yet their productivity remains moderate (3.2).
- All platforms (Telegram, Facebook, Instagram) showed *similar actual productivity scores (~4.9)*.
- This may indicate that *type of platform is less influential* than overall time spent. >*Conclusion*: Productivity does not drastically vary across platforms, but usage time does.

3.**Burnout Trends by Age, Gender, and Job Type (Line Chart)**
- This visual tracks *burnout perception across age bands* for the *finance sector*.
- Highest burnout reported by *young professionals (11–15 age group)*, declining gradually with age.
- This suggests younger employees in high-demand sectors feel more pressure or are less resilient.
> *Conclusion*: Job role and age are key burnout indicators — not just screen time.

4.**Stress Level by Sleep Hours and Job Type (Combo Chart)**
- Blue bars = number of users in each sleep bracket
- Black line = average stress level

- Stress *peaks when sleep is < 5 hours* and declines at *6–7 hours* of sleep.
- Stress rises again when sleep is too long (> 9 hours), possibly due to irregular routines or burnout.
> *Conclusion*: Optimal sleep (6–7 hrs) minimizes stress — a key wellness benchmark.

5.**Actual vs Social Media Time (Line Chart)**
- Productivity holds steady until 7–9 hrs/day of usage, then dips.
- After 10+ hrs/day, actual productivity *drops below 4.5*, showing a direct cost of overuse.
> *Conclusion*: There’s a *threshold (~9 hrs)* beyond which productivity drops sharply.

6. **Perceived Productivity vs Social Media Time**
- Interestingly, people *perceive themselves as more productive* even when their actual score drops.
- A *gap appears beyond 10 hrs/day*: people think they’re productive, but reality shows otherwise.
> *Conclusion*: Self-perception can be misleading — data reveals blind spots in self-evaluation.

7. **Platform Preferences (Donut Chart)**
- Platform choice is fairly evenly distributed.
- *Telegram and Instagram* lead slightly in preference.
- No major correlation between platform preference and job type or stress found.
> *Conclusion*: Preferences vary by individual; platform choice alone is not predictive.

Summary Insights
- **Moderate social media use (~3 hrs/day)** doesn’t significantly harm productivity
- **Sleep is the most impactful variable** in reducing stress and improving job satisfaction
- **Burnout is age- and job-type-dependent**, not just screen-based
- **Perceived productivity often overestimates reality**, especially at higher screen usage
